Competency test - Install SLOPE and fit SLOPE and lasso (hint: see the lambda argument in SLOPE()) models using the SLOPE package to the abalone data set that comes with SLOPE using a Poisson model. Plot the results. How do the paths from SLOPE and lasso compare?



Solution - easy1.R



Output - SLOPE MODEL.pdf and LASSO MODEL.pdf


Inference - For signma near 0 the SLOPE and Lasso models are similar however if sigma is big SLOPE model's beta don't go to 0 as quickly as Lasso model's beta.
